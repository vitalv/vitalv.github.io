I'm originally from Badajoz, Spain, close to Portugal in the south-west, where I studied Biology at the University. Those were some sweet years including very nice
memories from the year I spent as an Erasmus student in Montpellier, France, and one more year in Tenerife (Canary Islands).
</p>
<p>But then I grew an interest in computers and programming and not just Biology so I moved to Madrid to study a Master's program
in Bioinformatics combining these two passions I had (and still have).
In Madrid I started working in several research projects at UCM (Universidad Complutense Madrid) and the National Center
for Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC). After a few years I had published some results and decided to compile everything into a 
thesis and got my PhD degree in January 2016.

Madrid is lovely and lively but after over 10 years living there I decided to experience a new stage in my life as a post-doc abroad.
Stockholm is my place of residence now and I love it too. It's not as lively as Madrid, but fresher and prettier in my opinion.
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I'm an avid reader, traveller, scuba diver and trumpet player.
