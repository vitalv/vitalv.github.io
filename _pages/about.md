<p style="clear:both; margin-top: 100px;">
I'm originally from Badajoz, Spain, close to Portugal in the south-west, where I studied Biology at the University. Those were some sweet years including very nice
memories from the year I spent as an Erasmus student in Montpellier, France, and one more year in Tenerife (Canary Islands).
</p>
<p>But then I grew an interest in computers and programming and not just Biology so I moved to Madrid to study a Master's program
in Bioinformatics combining these two passions I had (and still have).
  
In Madrid I started working in several research projects at UCM (Universidad Complutense Madrid) and the National Center
for Biotechnology (CNB-CSIC). After a few years I had published some results and decided to compile everything into a 
thesis and got my PhD degree in January 2016. 
</p>
<p>
Madrid is lovely and lively but after over 10 years living there I decided to experience a new stage in my life as a post-doc abroad.
Stockholm is my 3rd hometown, after Badajoz and Madrid, and I love it too. It's not as lively as Madrid, but fresher and prettier in my opinion.
</p>

<p>  
In 2019, after my post-doc, I realized I didn't want to pursue the academic career. So I then started working as a data scientist for a tech-logistics startup company.
The work was related to optimizing routing (vehicle routing problem) and involved using maps, gps data and more... very interesting!  
Few more years went on and my next move is to come back to Spain. 
</p>
<p>
Update 2023: I live now in Valencia, Spain. Back to the homeland, I work as a Data Scientist. This time it's related to cargo/container ships and terminal operations: cool stuff
</p>
<p>
In my spare time I'm an avid reader, traveller, scuba diver and trumpet player.
