This here is a treemap generated using D3.js treemap and its resquarify function   
It was created as part of a project in which I studied the protein economy of the cell.  
The surface of the color-coded protein categories represent the mass fraction in proportion to total protein weight.   
Then the radio-buttons at the bottom represent different culture conditions, 60 and 300 represent light intensities;  
glc stands for glucose added to culture medium and dcmu is a photosynthesis inhibitor. This was quite revealing!
